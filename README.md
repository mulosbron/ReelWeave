# ReelWeave

ReelWeave is a decentralized movie and TV show tracking platform powered by Arweave. It allows users to connect their ArConnect wallet, browse movies and TV shows, create personal watchlists, share reviews with the community, and receive personalized recommendations based on their viewing history.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Your watchlists and preferences are stored permanently on the Arweave blockchain.
- **Community Driven**: Share reviews and recommendations with the community.
- **Personal Tracking**: Keep track of what you've watched and what you want to watch.
- **Smart Recommendations**: Get personalized suggestions based on your viewing history.

## Getting Started

1. Connect your ArConnect wallet.
2. Browse movies and TV shows.
3. Create your personal watchlists.
4. Share reviews with the community.
5. Get personalized recommendations.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
